```{r}
library(tidyverse)

```{r}
sales_full <- read_csv("sales_full_cleaned.csv")
```

```{r}
sales_full
```


```{r}
sales_global <- sales_full %>% 
  filter(sales_m > 0)

sales_global

```

```{r}
sales_shipped <- sales_full %>% 
  filter(total_shipped > 0)

sales_shipped
```

```{r}
sales_full %>% 
  arrange(year)
```

```{r}
#sales_global %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = ))
```

```{r}
sales_global_200 <- sales_global %>%
  arrange_(~ desc(sales_m)) %>%
  slice(1:200)

sales_global_200
```

```{r}
sales_shipped_200 <- sales_shipped %>%
  arrange_(~ desc(total_shipped)) %>%
  slice(1:200)
```

Sales Shipped is 2019 information

I will proceed on this basis in the short term and try to produce some insights as I am running out of time.

```{r}
view(sales_shipped_200)
```


```{r}
sales_shipped_200 %>% 
  group_by(genre) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = genre, fill = genre) ) +
  geom_bar()

ggsave("genre_count.png")
```

```{r}
sales_shipped_200 %>% 
  group_by(publisher) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = genre, fill = publisher) ) +
  geom_bar()
```

```{r}
sales_shipped_200 %>% 
  group_by(developer) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = genre, fill = developer) ) +
  geom_bar()
```

```{r}
sales_shipped_200 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = total_shipped, y = critic_score), color = scale_fill_brewer()) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r}

```{r}
