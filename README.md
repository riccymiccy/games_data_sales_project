I had five days to plan, clean and present data that needed to be presented to answer some specififc business questions for a client.

## Project Brief

Client is a small games developer who is planning next release and want to use Data to decide what kind of game to make.

They have 2 datasets with historical information on top selling games OF ALL TIME and want to understand what TYPES of games sell a lot of copies. In particular they are looking for the direction to take their company in.

## Tools

The data was from two datasets. I was coding in R.

The dashboard was created shinydashboard with the following libraries: 
- `library(tidyverse)`              
- `library(here)`
- `library(janitor)`


## How I spent my time
Day 1: I spent a long time planning and trying to answer the business question and determine the insights and ideas that might be good toinvestigate.





## Insights


  
  

### Key Take-aways

- As this a first attempt at cleaning data and presenting it, I realise now there are lots of ways to ask the questions.

- Practice is incredibly important to get data wrangling right and equally, once you have cleaned it once, you often go back and clean a second and third time before you can get it to do what you want.

- It's important to spend a lot of time trying to answer the business question before attempting to do anything. Writing down the plan is also equally important.
